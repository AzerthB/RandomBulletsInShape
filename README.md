# RandomBulletsInShape
Warhammer 40k applet to randomize artillery &amp; firearm bullets in a tabletop area.


# Installation
There are two options to run this applet;
- Online : go to http://eloibonneville.com/RandomBulletsInShape/index.html and use the app
- Locally : Install python3 on your windows deskop, download source code and run startapp.bat. This will open up a local python server and the corresponding url on your default browser. MacOS also works but you need to manually run the serveur-web.py using python instead of a single click-to-launch batch file.
